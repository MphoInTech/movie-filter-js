# 🎬 Movie Ratings Program

This is a simple **JavaScript program** that allows you to:
- 🎥 Add movies and their IMDb ratings  
- 🛑 Stop input anytime by pressing Cancel  
- 🔎 Display movies with ratings **less than 7**  
- 🌟 Display movies with ratings **7 or higher**

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The program uses `prompt()` to ask for a movie name and its rating.
2. Movies are stored in an array as objects, for example:
   { movie: "Inception", rating: 8.8 }
3. It then displays movies filtered by rating below or above 7.
